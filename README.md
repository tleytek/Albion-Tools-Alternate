## 1. Black Market Crafter

#### Reminders

Crafting cost is 1/20th on the item value

Focus is reduced by initial-focus-cost \* 0.5^(total-focus-proficiency/10000) **exponential decay formula**

Because we are competing with black market flippers, we have to keep an eye on the auction house prices. When an item in the auction house is cheaper than a buy order from the black market, we run the risk of a flipper getting to the order before we do, therefore the item is deemed RISKY. and vice versa for items that are more expensive than a buy order in the black market. Our ideal item is one that is more expensive in the AH than a buy order in the BM but cheaper to craft using refined materials from the AH.
